These systems face challenges from numerous interdependent factors, such as satellite handovers, congestion, flight maneuvers, and seasonal variations, making accurate network performance prediction complex. Currently, there is no established methodology for predicting network performance in avionic communication systems. This paper addresses this gap by proposing machine learning-based approaches for pre-flight network performance prediction. Specifically, we leverage transformer models to predict quality of service (QoS) along a given flight path using real-world data. The model takes as input a variety of positional and network-related features, such as aircraft location, satellite information, historical network performance, and handover probabilities, and outputs a predicted performance score for each position along the flight. This approach allows for proactive decision-making, enabling flight crews to select the most optimal flight paths before departure, improving overall operational efficiency in business aviation.</p></body></html>

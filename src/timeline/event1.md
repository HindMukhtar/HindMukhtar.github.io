I transitioned from hardware engineering to data science by accepting a Data Scientist position at Satcom Direct. This role enabled me to apply my AI/ML expertise while drawing on my industry experience. In this role, I: 
- Designed and deployed predictive ML models for satellite communication systems, including:
    - Sequence-to-sequence transformer forecasting network performance along flight paths
    - Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prediction model leveraging aircraft location and satellite coverage
- Applied large language models (LLMs) to parse and process aircraft communication text logs, integrating
unstructured data into predictive modeling workflows
- Led company-wide AI initiatives, introducing ML solutions to optimize network performance and developing an
internal AI/ML library to accelerate experimentation and training
- Performed statistical analyses quantifying the impact of demand growth on satellite networks to support
provider capacity planning
- Architected real-time monitoring pipelines on Azure (Functions, Durable Functions, Blob Storage) enabling live
metric tracking, anomaly detection, and proactive issue resolution
- Integrated Prefect for orchestration, automating workflows, deployments, and pipelines across departments
- Automated reporting pipelines (performance dashboards, usage reports, TAM analysis) to support data-driven
decision-making across sales and leadership

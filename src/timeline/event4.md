Completed a 4 month long internship where I: 
- Designed the electrical arrangement for a strict-deadline emergency replacement of potential transformers at a high voltage transmission station, preventing the transformers from going out of service 
- Demonstrated knowledge of CAD simulation tools and circuit analysis by performing an arc flash study to determine the level of personal protective equipment necessary at the transmission station
- Researched, analyzed data and provided feedback for continuous Improvement initiatives (Design and drawings quality, Asset registry timeliness, Asset registry accuracy) which aided in the investigation of systemic issues

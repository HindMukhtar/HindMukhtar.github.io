I greatly enjoyed the research I conducted during my masterâ€™s and decided to continue into a PhD. This time, I aimed to incorporate my industrial experience into my research. As a result, I chose to explore the application of AI and ML in avionic communication, with a particular focus on satellite communication. I am currently in my final year.

Hi, I'm Hind, a passionate data scientist with a focus on AI-enabled wireless communications. I'm currently in the final year of my PhD, where my research explores the intersection of AI, communication systems, and the aviation industry. Specifically, I’m working on optimizing avionic communication networks with machine learning techniques like reinforcement learning, generative AI, and deep neural networks.

I’m originally from Toronto, but I moved to Ottawa in 2019 for work and graduate studies and have been calling this city home ever since. When I’m not buried in data or fine-tuning algorithms, you’ll find me enjoying life outside of work. I love to travel and explore new places, and recently, I’ve taken up cycling, discovering the beautiful trails of Ottawa. I’m also a big fan of staying active, and working out is a big part of my routine.

In addition to my research, I’m passionate about connecting with like-minded folks at events hosted by my local Google Developers and Women Techmakers groups. I’m a strong believer in the power of community, which is why I’m constantly learning and sharing knowledge to help build AI expertise within my company and beyond.

Feel free to explore my work, and let’s connect if you’re passionate about AI, data science, or just want to talk tech!

Hi, I’m Hind, an engineer, data scientist and applied AI researcher. 
Unlike many who enter AI through computer science, my path began in electrical engineering. I started my career designing satellite communication systems for aviation. Working at the intersection of physical systems, reliability, and performance sparked my curiosity about how intelligence could be layered onto infrastructure. That curiosity led me back to graduate school, where I completed a Master’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering and ultimately transitioned into data science.

Today, I’m in the final year of my PhD, focused on AI-enabled communication systems. My research explores how machine learning,  particularly reinforcement learning and deep learning, can optimize network performance in dynamic, real-world environments. I’m especially interested in building AI systems that are not just theoretically elegant, but operationally robust. Alongside my doctoral work, I’ve spent over seven years in industry, evolving from hardware engineering into leading applied AI initiatives. That transition continues to shape how I approach problems, grounded in engineering fundamentals, informed by data, and focused on practical impact.

Outside of research, I’m happiest exploring new places. I love to travel, stay active, and recently picked up cycling. Fitness is a core part of my routine, and I value the discipline and mental clarity it brings. I’m also deeply committed to community. I actively engage in the broader technology ecosystem through the Google Developer Group, where I attend and volunteer at community events. I also share my work through academic publications, conference presentations and personal blog posts. I am motivated not only by building AI systems, but by influencing how technology is understood and applied. For me, impact extends beyond deployment, it includes knowledge-sharing and mentorship.

If you’re interested in AI, applied machine learning, or the intersection of research and real-world systems, I’d love to connect!

This paper proposes an outdoor localization scheme using image classification and deep learning by using information from satellite images and signals in the LTE band. We propose a two-step solution comprised of image differencing using satellite images to classify users into regions, and feed forward neural networks that take channel state information (CSI) data as an input to predict the user's longitude and latitude. We use real data collected from an LTE-A mobile communication system to assess the performance of our technique. Our results show an improvement in localization accuracy using the region based approach, despite the limited data provided from the single input, single output (SISO) system, as we achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.83 m. The proposed technique can be supplementary to GPS in urban canyons with weak GPS penetration.

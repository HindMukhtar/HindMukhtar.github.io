Satellite-based communication systems are integral to delivering high-speed data services in aviation, particularly for business aviation operations requiring global connectivity. These systems, however, are challenged by a multitude of interdependent factors such as satellite handovers, congestion, flight maneuvers and seasonal trends, making network performance prediction a complex task. No established methodologies currently exist for network performance prediction in avionic communication systems. This paper addresses the gap by proposing a machine learning (ML)-based approaches for pre-flight network performance predictions. The proposed models predict performance along a given flight path, taking as input positional and network-related information and outputting the predicted performance for each position. In business aviation, flight crews typically have multiple flight plans to choose from for each city pair, allowing them to select the most optimal option. This approach enables proactive decision-making, such as selecting optimal flight paths prior to departure.

As a Toastmasters member, Iâ€™m committed to strengthening my leadership and public speaking skills by consistently pushing myself outside my comfort zone. From introducing myself in the Ice Breaker project to sharing travel experiences and breaking down AI concepts for non-technical audiences, I enjoy the challenge of engaging with others and building confidence through regular club participation.

As a panelist at Nile Legacy's youth-focused event, I had the privilege of sharing my journey in AI and data science with students and early-career Sudanese professionals. Through an open and honest discussion, I aimed to inspire and encourage the next generation to pursue their ambitions in the tech sector. In addition to speaking, I engaged with attendees through networking sessions, fostering meaningful connections and supporting a community of emerging leaders.

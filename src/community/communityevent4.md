I presented my paper “SkyNetPredictor: Network Performance Prediction in Avionic Communication using AI” at the IEEE International Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC) 2025 in Bologna, Italy.

The work introduces a novel AI-enabled framework for predicting network performance in avionic satellite communication systems, with applications in optimizing in-flight connectivity.

Our paper was nominated for the Best Paper Award, recognizing its contribution to advancing AI methods in real-world communication networks.

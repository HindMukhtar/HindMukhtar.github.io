I presented my research on applying VAEGANs for air traffic prediction at the IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Communication in Stockholm, Sweden. The conference provided a valuable opportunity to share my work, network with professionals in the field, and gain new insights. I also had the chance to tour Ericssonâ€™s innovation studio, where I explored their latest advancements in 5G and 6G technologies.
